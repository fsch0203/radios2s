# RadioS2S

RadioS2S is an android application with which you can listen to every radio station that is available on the web. There are already more than 12.000 stations available, but you can add your own if one is missing. Every weblink that is playable in a webbrowser (HTML5) can be added.

We have tried to make the user interface as simple as possible:
* select on country, style (genre) or language
* quick search by typing in (part of the) the name of the station
* give one or more stars if you want to save a station as a favorit
* cast to chromecast audio

With a chromecast (audio) device connected you can now listen to every station on your home music system.

Radio S2S is working together with Community Radio Browser, a wiki-like directory of internet radio stations of around the world.

## Usage

The android apk is build in build.phonegap.com.
