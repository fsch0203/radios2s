# RadioS2S

RadioS2S is an android application and chrome extension with which you can listen to every radio station that is available on the web. You can already choose from more than 17.000 stations, but you can add your own if one is missing. Every weblink that is playable in a webbrowser (HTML5) can be added. With the quick search option it's very easy to find you station.

You can find the Android app in the [Google Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scriptel.simplyradio). And the Chrome extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/radio-station-to-station/bjgdhmgldpmbfokgehkdkddahldjjmnc).

We have tried to make the user interface as simple as possible:
* select on country, style (genre) or language
* quick search by typing in (part of the) the name of the station
* give one or more stars if you want to save a station as a favorite
* cast to chromecast audio

With a chromecast (audio) device connected you can now listen to every station on your home music system.

Radio S2S is working together with Community Radio Browser, a wiki-like directory of internet radio stations from around the world.
